    <p>
        The perfect western snack, <em>Cowboy Candy</em> turns your average jalapeno into a jar of 
        sweet, tangy, and spicy bite sized japapenos. These candied jalapenos can be prepared for any 
        portion size, but our recipe today yields about one whole quart of candied jalapenos.

        While these take a minimum of three days to be fully complete to eat, they can be stored for up to 
        three months. This is precicely why our recipe today will result in a good amount of servings for 
        the whole family. Some preparation includes the required tools for making our dish, including jars 
        for storage, measuring cups, and measuring spoons. The ingredients necessary inclide chopped jalapenos, 
        brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, garlic poweder, celery seed, ground tumeric, cumin seedm anise 
        seed, salt, and red pepper flakes. It is advised to aquire a pint-sized canning jar to mix, 
        refrigerate, and store your <em>Cowboy Candy</em> (measurments for ingredients will be presented below).

    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound jalapeno peppers sliced into 1/4 inch pieces</li>
        <li>3/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon celery seed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons ground tumeric</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cumin seed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon anise seed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 pint-sized canning jar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Directions:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>While wearing gloves, rinse your jalapenos before cutting them into 1/4 inch slices. Removing the seeds
            before preparing would result in less spicy japapenos.
        </li>
        <li>Combine your brown sugar and apple cider vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic 
            powder, celery seed, tumeric, cumin seed, anise seed, salt and red pepper flakes. Bring this 
            to a simmer for 3 minutes. Add your sliced jalapenos and simmer for another 4 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove jalapenos to a jar with a slotted spoon. Continue simmering the liquid over medium to low 
            heat until it's slightly thickened for about 10 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the liquid you made over the jalapenos and let cool. With a strainer, remove the excess seeds from 
            the liquid if you desire (making overall servings less spicy). Refrigerate in jar for at least 3 days for 
            them to be ready to eat. They can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 3 months.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        And just like that, you have yourself a few months worth of <em>Cowboy Candy</em>! Our recipe includes up to 24 
        servings, but this can vary depending on your preffered serving size. Now enjoy your slice of the 'old west', and don't 
        forget to save any extra liquid left over! It'll make an excellent syrup for a spicy margarita ;) !
